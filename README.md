Hi there! 🌟 As I gear up for my second year at Northeastern University, I reflect on my journey so far. My time as a **Machine Learning Engineer Co-op** at **Lendbuzz** was a standout experience. Integrating vLLM into systems and achieving a 175% inference speedup was a highlight, combining technical challenges with real-world impact. 

I’m also immersed in exciting research at **The Helping Hands Lab**, guided by [Dr. Robert Platt](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/people/), where I work on advancing **robotic grasping and manipulation systems**. 🤖 At the **CHATS Lab** under [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/), my focus lies on building **interactive AI systems**, **privacy-preserving AI**, and **multi-modal conversational agents**. 💬

On a different front, I collaborate with [Dr. Rachel F. Adler](http://rachelfadler.com) at the **Information Experience and Accessibility Lab** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign**. Here, I contribute to projects enhancing accessibility in **fintech** and **mHealth** for older adults. 🏦

## About Me

Before grad school, I honed my skills as a **Technical Manager** at Zhejiang Chongxiao Zhong Han Medical Technology Co., driving operational improvements of up to 80%. My academic path included impactful research at **Wenzhou University of Technology**, **Wenzhou Bopu Institute of Big Data**, and **MIE DEMO Studio**, where I tackled diverse projects from public opinion analysis to launching a volunteer management platform. 

_**Feel free to reach out! ✨ Whether for collaboration, brainstorming, or just exchanging ideas, I’d love to connect and explore new possibilities together. 💡**_
